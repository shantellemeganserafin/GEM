## Undergraduate Research Scholarship: GEM - The Game for Female Growth Mindset Development ##
“In a growth mindset, people believe that their most basic abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work - brains and talent are just the starting point. This view creates a love of learning and a resilience that is essential for great accomplishment.” 

## Inspiration ##
My goal was to increase confidence and empower women in pursuit of social, political, and economic equality. After analyzing case studies and conducting user interviews, I found that the underlying issue was the fixed mindset. This fixed mindset was developed through generations of societies telling women that they can’t vote and that their voice doesn’t matter or their only role belongs in the kitchen or telling young women their value lies in their looks over their brains or telling women to rely on marrying rich man or a lack of representation in a STEM classroom. The contributing external factors to this fixed mindset are countless. As an innovative, sustainable, and scalable solution I built GEM - The Game for Female Growth Mindset Development. 

## Research Articles and References ##
Mindset, The New Psychology of Success by Carol Dweck, and two case studies influenced my design process. The first case was by David Dunning & Joyce Ehrlinger that concluded that when compared to men, women underestimated their scientific performance because they thought less of their general scientific abilities. The second case was by Hewlett-Packard that concluded that women were less likely to seek out a top management opportunity unless they felt 100% ready.

## What it does ##
The game consists of four levels that correlate to the four waves of feminism, respectively. These levels are the “Women’s Suffrage Movement”, “Challenging Gender Roles”, “Intersectional Feminism”, and “Women in the Workforce.” Each level consists of a single main task and four subtasks. The character cannot complete the main task initially but must develop the appropriate skills through the four subtasks first. This design was inspired by the practice of developing a growth mindset. This practice consists of reflection, mindfulness, feedback, focusing on not yet rather than never, consistency, and hard work. These main tasks include breaking a barrier, pushing a tire, jumping to the stars, and giving a business pitch. The first subtask is Pebble, where the character is physically preparing for the main task. The second subtask is Flower, where the character is building a positive self-image through affirmation-based prompts and responses. The third subtask is Star, where the character develops knowledge by learning about a leading female figure during that wave of feminism. The fourth subtask is Butterfly, where the character develops mental wellbeing through reflection and gratitude prompts and response.

## How I built it ##
The video game was built with Pygame, Python, and Object-Oriented Design & Programming. The game flow, user experience, and user interface were designed in multiple iterations using mentor and target user feedback. The visual components (e.g. character sprite, graphics) were adopted from free online resources. 

## Challenges I ran into ##
My biggest challenge was designing my program. It was initially difficult to map out exactly how I wanted to structure my code, classes, and objects. At times, there were things I had to change visually to have optimal performance with my code. 

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of ##
I am proud that I took what I learned in University into my hands. For instance, I was able to adapt what I learned in Object-Oriented Design & Programming to structure my project. Additionally, I was able to pick up a new language, Python, relatively quickly. 

## What I learned ##
The biggest thing I learned was how to scope an entire project from design to implementation.

## What's next for GEM ##
I plan to collect and analyze user data from the game to measure its effectiveness. "What does the user learn from this game? Is the user engaged with the prompts?" I plan to set up a backend to retrieve responses to prompts and send the game to young women in local high schools in the San Diego Area. In the future, I visualize GEM becoming a platform that holds short games that introduce women to valuable concepts (e.g. growth mindset, nutrition, financial literacy).
